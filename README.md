Forked from <https://github.com/svengiebel/atom-compile-less> and rewritten in ES6 with additional features.

# Atom Compile Less

Just a LESS compiler for the awesome Atom.io Editor.

Configurable Less to CSS on save. Optionally generates sourcemaps and creates visual notifications on success or error.
